Babble Build 1.4.2.1
====================
--Improvements
1) Chat windows are now resizeable

Babble Build 1.4.1.2
====================
--Improvements
1) The bubble tooltip that pops up when user minimizes the main Babble window now remains open for 2 secs, down from 4
2) Addbuddyform's accept button is now the default button of the form.
3) Added an option under the Help menu to open the revisions text file.
--Bugs
1) Fixed a bug where the chatformlist count gets reset to 0 when the main form's minimized by clicking on the red X button (which
initializes the formclosing event). This bug has caused the program to lose track of the open chat windows and when a new message comes in
it opens a new one even when a chat window with the same hostname is already open. In fact, chatformlist is now obsolete, the built-in 
function Application.OpenForms is used in its place.
2) Fixed a bug where a host not found exception is thrown if there is a chat window open with a non-existent or invalid host name.

Babble Build 1.3.6.2
====================
--Improvements

worked.

====================
--Improvements
